//! Package service implementation and core business logic
//!
//! This module provides the main service layer for package operations in the selfie library.
//! It implements the hexagonal architecture pattern with the `PackageService` trait as the
//! primary port for package management operations.
//!
//! The service handles all package lifecycle operations including installation, checking,
//! validation, and information retrieval. It coordinates between the package repository,
//! command execution, and event streaming to provide a complete package management experience.
