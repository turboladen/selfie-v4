//! Package repository port and error types
//!
//! This module defines the core port for package repository operations in the
//! hexagonal architecture. The `PackageRepository` trait abstracts package
//! storage and retrieval, allowing different implementations (YAML files,
//! databases, remote repositories, etc.) while maintaining a consistent interface.
