//! DotfileService implementation
//!
//! This module provides the concrete implementation of the [`DotfileService`] trait.
//! It coordinates between the package repository (for loading package dotfiles),
//! the file system (for reading/writing dotfiles), and the application config
//! to perform dotfile deployment operations.
