//! Leak regression for the general command-failure path.
//!
//! selfie runs user-defined commands and cannot know which of them print a
//! credential, so a failure value that every adapter receives must not carry a
//! command's whole output. `CommandFailure::ExecutionFailed` therefore has no
//! `stdout` field, and these tests fail if one comes back.
//!
//! **This deliberately does not scan every event for the secret**, the way the
//! dotfile leak tests do. That pattern belongs to the dotfile resolve path, where
//! resolved content never enters an event at all. On the
//! package path a check command's output entering the event stream *is* the
//! design: `CheckResultCompleted` carries it so that `selfie package check` can
//! display it, and `PackageEvent::Info` streams an install command's output live.
//! Scanning every event here would assert something this path never promised and
//! could never pass. The narrower claim — that the *failure value* stays clean —
//! is the one worth locking, because that value reaches adapters that never asked
//! for command output.
